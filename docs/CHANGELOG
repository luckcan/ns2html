             Version: 0.4.1
             Fixes: - Old error proccessing was corrected:
                       > Vsys support was corrected when naming HTML files.
                       > There was an error when proccessing the rules actions. 
                         We only was able to proccess 'permit', 'deny', etc 
                         (only in lowercase). Now, we use REGEX to proccess all
                         occurency of actions.
